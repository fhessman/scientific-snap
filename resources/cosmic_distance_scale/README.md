Here are some data that can be used to measure the distance to cosmic objects, fron the Sun to distant galaxies.
Since there is no single object type that can be used for this purpose - fortunately, supernovae don't go off very often in our neighborhood!!! - one has to use a cosmic "distance ladder" consisting of several "rungs".
- First, one measures the distance from the Earth to the Sun (the "Astronomical Unit").
- One can then use this standard distance to measure the distances to nearby stars using trigonometry: as the Earth goes around the Sun, the apparent positions of nearby stars shifts relative to the background of distant stars (sterioscopy!).
- Once one has measured the distance to local pulsating stars called "Cepheids", one can use their brightness variations to measure the distance of external galaxies containing Cepheid stars of their own.
- If one can measure both a Cepheid star and a Supernova of type "Ia" in a galaxy, then one can use other type Ia supernovae to measure the distances to much further galaxies.
- Once galaxies are distant enough, their distances can be measured using their "red-shifts" - the amount of apparent Doppler Shift measured using spectral lines (it's not really a Doppler shift - the shift is mostly caused by the expansion of the universe, not by the galaxy's actual motion within it's own space-time).
