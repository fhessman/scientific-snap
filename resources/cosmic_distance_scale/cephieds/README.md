So-called "Cepheids" are special pulsating stars that change their brightness as their size and apparent temperature changes.  Because the period of their pulsation (and hence brightness variations) is related to their luminosity (how much total energy they radiate per unit time), they can be used to estimate the distances to their host galaxies via the relationship

Flux (how much energy per area we see at our distance) = Luminosity / 4pi distance^2
