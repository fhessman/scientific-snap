Here are two sets of images of fields in the Large Magellanic Cloud taken by the MACHO project with the old 50-inch telescope at Mt. Stromo in Australia.  There are several Cepheid variable stars visible in each field whose positions are shown in the accompanying finder charts.  In each field, a standard star is indicated whose apparent brightness ("flux") is known (shown in the table below).

| Dataset | Number of Images | Filter | Apparent brightness | Filter of Reference Star | Description |
| MACHO LMC field #1 | 13 | red (non-standard) | 2.19x10-15 W/m2 | very faint Cepheids, so periods not obivous at first |
| MACHO LMC field #2 | 25 | red (non-standard) | 2.33x10-15 W/m2 | Cepheids of different brightnesses |
