The effects of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity (GR) are usually only measureable in a laboratory situation using very precise instruments (eg. atomic clocks).
Astronomically, the effects are much larger due to the larger masses involved.

One easily observed example of GR is gravitational lensing.
When light passes by a mass, it's path is geometrically diverted by the curved space-time around the object.
We can see the effects of this distortion as a bundling of light rays, making an object in the backtround appear brighter and distorted.
In the case of stars as gravitational "lenses", it is very difficult to see the tiny amount of distortion of a background star, but it's easy to see the amplification effect: the backtground star's brightness can increase temporarily by a very large factor (indeed, one rarely sees the unmagnified lensing star so easily).

Here is a data set consisting of many images taken of a so-called "microlensed" background star: measure it's varying brightness with time.  If one can estimate the distance and space-velocity of the lensing star, the time it takes for the microlensing event to take place enables one to estimate the mass of the star and even look for circumstellar companions and planets (they also create their own microlensing effects, albeit usually much smaller).
