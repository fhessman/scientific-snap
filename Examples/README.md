Here are many examples of how to use Snap! in order to solve some scientific problem.  Most projects are **NOT** given as finished XML files but as detailed outlines of how one can easily find a solution in gradual and easy steps. Although not containing code per se, they are kept here close to the additional Sprites and blocks needed.

In addition, there are completed examples without any description ready to be run. It's not that you cannot programme them yourselves, but sometimes it's simply nice to play with a finished simulation.

## Examples only with instructions

Here is an indication of the relative programming difficulty (the undocumented examples have names in parentheses):

If the projects are not yet filled, that's only because we haven't gotten around to writing it up.
