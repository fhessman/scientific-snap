Here are many examples of how to use Snap! in order to solve some scientific problem.  The projects are **NOT** given as finished XML files but as detailed outlines of how one can easily find a solution in gradual and easy steps. Although not containing code per se, they are kept here close to the additional Sprites and blocks needed.

Here is an indication of the relative programming difficulty:

| **Example** | **Description** | **Difficulty** |
| StellarParallax | Simulating the shift of foreground stars due to the Earth's motion | beginner |
| KeplerOrbit | Simulating the effects of gravity felt by a planet | beginner (once you understand the maths) |
| LunarPhases | Moving and rotating *Sprites* to simulation the formation of Lunar phases | beginner to intermediate ||
| Pandemic | Moving and sensing the closness of *Sprites* to simulate a pandemic | beginner to intermediate |
| ExoplanetTransit | Simulating the appearance of an exoplanet transit and reading the brightness of the Stage to create a lightcurve | beginner to intermediate |
| EclipsingBinary | Simulating the appearance of an eclipse binary star system and measuring the lightcurve | intermediate |
| StellarStructure | Solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for a star or planet | intermediate |
| TrafficJam | Simulating a traffic jam caused by heavy traffic | intermediate |
| RemoteSensing | Accessing and plotting mobile-phone data recorded by PhyPhox | intermediate |
| ParameterFitting | Fitting a model to data using a Monte Carlo Markov Process | advanced |

If the projects are not yet filled, that's only because we haven't gotten around to writing it up.
