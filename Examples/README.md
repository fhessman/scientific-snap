Here are many examples of how to use Snap! in order to solve some scientific problem.  The projects are **NOT** given as finished XML files but as detailed outlines of how one can easily find a solution in gradual and easy steps. Although not containing code per se, they are kept here close to the additional Sprites and blocks needed.

Here is an indication of the relative programming difficulty (the undocumented examples have names in parentheses):

| Example  | Description  | Difficulty  | Field |
| :-----:  | :---------:  | :--------:  | :---: |
| (Archery) | Simulating an archer | beginner  | physics |
| StellarParallax  | Simulating the shift of foreground stars due to the Earth's motion  | beginner  | astronomy |
| KeplerOrbit  | Simulating the effects of gravity felt by a planet  | beginner (once you understand the maths)  | physics |
| LunarPhases  | Moving and rotating *Sprites* to simulation the formation of Lunar phases  | beginner to intermediate  | astronomy |

| EclipsingBinary  | Simulating the appearance of an eclipse binary star system and measuring the lightcurve  | intermediate  | astronomy |
| (ExoplanetDetection)  | Simulating the spectroscopic signal of an exoplanet host star | intermediate  | astronomy |
| (AutonomousDriving) | Simulating an autonomously driving car  | beginner to advanced | engineering |
| (TrafficJam)  | Simulating a traffic jam caused by heavy traffic  | intermediate to advanced | engineering |
| StellarStructure  | Solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for a star or planet  | advanced | physics/astronomy |
| (ParameterFitting)  | Fitting a model to data using a Monte Carlo Markov Process  | advanced  | mathematics |

If the projects are not yet filled, that's only because we haven't gotten around to writing it up.
